The website contains of two web-pages - an index page which has a form to input 
1. Name of class 
2. Strength of class

of each student.

On first click the button changes to green color and with another click it change to red.
Phases of the buttons -:

   absent.

   beused to mark all students as present and then mark the remaining absent students, hence saving 
   some time.
